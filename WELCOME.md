### Welcome to Hummaps

Visit [hummaps.com](https://hummaps.com) and your welcome might best be described as stark: 
a little box and **No Maps.** 

These server logs and their comentary are here to help you avoid the pitfalls 
of your predecessors.
The little box is powerful for the user that understands the rules and unforgiving
for those that don't. 

No worries though. Hummaps has training wheels: **Popup Search**
