### Welcome to Hummaps

Visit [hummaps.com](https://hummaps.com) and your welcome might best be described as stark: 
a little box and **No Maps.** 

These server logs and their commentary are here to help you avoid the pitfalls 
of your predecessors. The little box is powerful for users that understand the 
rules and unforgiving for those that don't. 

No worries though. Hummaps has training wheels: the **Popup Search**

![Hummaps popup search](https://github.com/chasmack/hummaps/blob/master/docs/popup.jpg)

Click on `popup` next to the little box. Information from the popup search is written 
into the little box and sent out for search. Eventually you may decide you can type your 
own searches into the little box.

Good luck and happy searching!
